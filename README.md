# Notetaker-Application
## Codebase for a notetaker application

## Description
The purpose of this project was to build off given starter code to create a note taker application that connects to a backend express.js server, and to facilitate front and back-end implementation.

## Learnings/takeaways
Takeaways from this project was the struggle to write the input from the frontend to the db.json file in the backend. It was a challenge to put everything together and make the application function to begin with, but that part was not able to be achieved.
